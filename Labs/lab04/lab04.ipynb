We just passed the name of the function, with no parentheses, to `apply`, because all we want to do is let `apply` know the name of the function we’d like to use and the name of the column we’d like to use it on. `apply` will then call the function `convert_pay_string_to_number` on each value in the column for us!

But there are many things that don't.  The string manipulation we did in today's lab is one example.  Since you can write any code you want in a function, `apply` gives you greater control over how you operate on data."

The values in this column are *strings*, not numbers, so like the `Total Pay` column, it's not usable without a bit of extra work.\n",

For example, if your pay is $\\$120$ this year, and that's an increase of 50% from the previous year, then your previous year's pay was $\\frac{\\$120}{1 + \\frac{50}{100}}$, or \\$80.\n",
