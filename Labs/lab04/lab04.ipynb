But there are many things that don't.  The string manipulation we did in today's lab is one example.  Since you can write any code you want in a function, `apply` gives you greater control over how you operate on data."

For CEOs with no previous year on record, it instead says \"(No previous year)\".  The values in this column are *strings*, not numbers, so like the `Total Pay` column, it's not usable without a bit of extra work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your current pay and the percentage increase from the previous year, you can compute your previous year's pay.  For example, if your pay is $\\$120$ this year, and that's an increase of 50% from the previous year, then your previous year's pay was $\\frac{\\$120}{1 + \\frac{50}{100}}$, or \\$80.\n",

    "Earlier, we computed the average pay among the CEOs in our 102-CEO dataset.  The average doesn't tell us everything about the amounts CEOs are paid, though.  Maybe just a few CEOs make the bulk of the money, even among these 102.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a *histogram* method to display the *distribution* of a set of numbers.  The table method `hist` takes a single argument, the name of a column of numbers.  It produces a histogram of the numbers in that column.\n",

    "**Question 4.1.** Make a histogram of the total pay of the CEOs in `compensation`. Check with a peer or instructor to make sure you have the right plot. *If you get a warning, ignore it.*\n",
